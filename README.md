Hi, I’m @eweisser! After several years in South Korea, I'm back in the USA.
I’m currently learning Java, and how to use Django. Way back, I used to enjoy writing stuff in BASIC for my TI-83, but it's been a while. Remind me to tell you about it!

Besides coding, I’m interested in linguistics, languages, cooking, history, onomastics...and the list goes on.

I'd love to collaborate on...well, nearly anything! Bonus points for the subjects I've mentioned above, naturally.
