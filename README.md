Hi, I’m @eweisser! Born and raised in the US, living in South Korea for the time being.
I’m currently learning Java, and I'm just starting some lessons on React. I'm no expert, but I have quite a bit of experience with CSS, and a fair amount with Python.
Way back, I used to enjoy writing stuff in BASIC for my TI-83, but it's been a while.

Besides coding, I’m interested in linguistics, languages, cooking, history, onomastics...and the list goes on.

I'd love to collaborate on...well, at the moment, I'd be up for any suggestions as long as I wouldn't be dead weight! Bonus points for the subjects I've mentioned above, naturally.
